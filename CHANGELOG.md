# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Bridge opens files in Photoshop.** Select a PSD in Bridge and press Enter: it opens in Photoshop, and after you save there Bridge shows the updated thumbnail. Tested with real keys, 3 of 3.

- **Pen pressure in Photoshop without editing a settings file.** `adobewine photoshop` now adds `UseSystemStylus 0` to Photoshop's PSUserConfig.txt (unless you have your own line), so Photoshop reads the pen through WinTab, which carries pressure under Wine, instead of Windows Ink. From Neutron's launcher, where it was measured on a Cintiq 22HD; thanks to the Neutron project.

- **Lightroom Classic and Bridge send photos to Photoshop as layers and Smart Objects.** In Lightroom, Photo > Edit In > Open as Smart Object in Photoshop and Open as Layers in Photoshop work, and in Bridge, Tools > Photoshop > Load Files into Photoshop Layers builds one document with a layer per file. Tested with real clicks, 3 of 3 each.

- **Lightroom Classic no longer crashes on Open as Layers in Photoshop.** Photo > Edit In > Open as Layers in Photoshop ended in an "Assertion failed" message and Adobe's error report. Lightroom fills a shape made of several outlines, one left open, and Wine's filling code only closed the last one. Patch 0132.

- **Lightroom Classic's Edit in Photoshop works, and its dialog shows its choices.** Photo > Edit In > Edit in Adobe Photoshop (Ctrl+E) opens the photo in Photoshop, and after you save there Lightroom adds the edited copy and shows the change. The "Edit Photo with Adobe Photoshop" dialog used to show only grey descriptions, with no buttons to pick "Edit a Copy with Lightroom Adjustments", "Edit a Copy" or "Edit Original". Lightroom gives back the drawing surface the buttons hand it while they draw. On Windows the buttons draw into a private buffer, so nothing is lost; Wine handed over the buttons' own surface. Wine now draws themed buttons through a buffer too, checked against Windows 11. Patch 0131. Tested with real clicks, 3 of 3.

- **Photoshop and Illustrator files placed in InDesign round-trip with Edit Original.** Select the placed image, choose Edit > Edit Original, change it in Photoshop or Illustrator and save, and InDesign updates the link and shows the change when you switch back. Tested with real clicks, 3 of 3 each.

- **Edit in Adobe Audition works from Premiere.** Edit > Edit in Adobe Audition > Clip extracts the audio, opens it in Audition, and after you change and save it there, Premiere's clip plays the new version. Tested with real clicks, 3 of 3. Like on Windows, Premiere lets go of its media files when you switch to another app, so Audition can save over them.

- **Premiere's time rulers show every marker and time number again.** With GPU-accelerated UI, the Timeline, Source and Program monitor rulers only showed the rightmost marker and time number, and the ticks disappeared when Time Ruler Numbers was on (#28). Premiere draws each ruler item separately onto one image, and Wine started each drawing from a blank image, erasing the ones before. Patch 0130 keeps what is already there.

- **Premiere's Save project dialog no longer has lines through it.** Wine drew a full-height line at the right edge of each round button (Save, Don't Save, Cancel). The buttons' outlines have a side line a few millionths of a unit long that runs backwards, and Wine turned that into a long spike. Patch 0129 skips lines that short.

- **Illustrator art round-trips with Premiere and After Effects.** An .ai file placed in a Premiere timeline opens in Illustrator with Edit > Edit Original (Ctrl+E), and Premiere shows the change after you save it in Illustrator. The same works from an After Effects comp, and a Photoshop file in an After Effects comp opens in Photoshop with Ctrl+E the same way. After Effects comps also render in Media Encoder through Composition > Add to Adobe Media Encoder Queue. Tested with real clicks, 3 of 3 each.
- **Animate works.** Animate 2024 installs from Creative Cloud and passes its first real-click tests: drawing, a shape tween, File > Export > Export Video/Media (rendered by Media Encoder), and publishing to SWF and HTML5 Canvas. `adobewine animate` starts it and `adobewine launchers` adds it to the menu. On the first start the Home screen can stay empty until you press Ctrl+N and answer "New to Animate?".
- **Premiere can use Intel graphics.** On Intel GPUs Premiere said "Hardware out of date" and rendered everything on the CPU. Three things were missing under Wine: Intel's driver counter that tells Premiere the GPU generation (added to DXVK, `scripts/build-gpu-deps.sh`), the OpenCL call that finds the GPU behind a Direct3D 11 device (patch 0127), and correct GPU details in DXCore, which named every GPU an "Intel HD Graphics 4000" (patch 0128). On an Iris Xe laptop, Premiere now picks "Mercury Playback Engine GPU Acceleration (OpenCL)" and its real-click tests pass 7/7. You need Intel's OpenCL driver (`intel-compute-runtime` on Arch, `intel-opencl` on Fedora, `intel-opencl-icd` on Ubuntu). Rerun `adobewine setup` after updating.
- **A warning when the graphics card is nearly full.** On Linux, NVIDIA's driver refuses video memory it doesn't have, where Windows would move other things out of the way. Premiere alone grows to about 5 GB, and Media Encoder keeps over 1 GB after an export, so on an 8 GB card Premiere's panels can come up blank or out of date and exports can fail with a GPU render error. `adobewine premiere`, `aftereffects` and `encoder` now say when less than 3 GB is free and which programs hold it, and after Premiere closes they tell you if panels failed for that reason.
- **Right app icons in the application menu.** `adobewine launchers` picked tool or document icons for several apps (Photoshop got "ADJUST", After Effects "GENERAL", InDesign the InCopy logo) and lost transparency for others. It now uses each app's default icon at full size with transparent corners; tested here on twelve apps. Contributed in #27.
- **Arch install instructions download the package first.** `pacman -U` with a web address fails because it asks for a signature file the release doesn't have; download, then install the file.
- **Hyprland: no more dark boxes around Photoshop's floating labels.** HUD readouts, smart-guide labels, tooltips and the splash showed large black boxes there. Patch 0108 by chikasimp (#23).
- **Panels and dialogs no longer keep showing an old picture.** After Effects dialogs such as the overwrite prompt often came up as a black box, and Premiere's Essential Sound panel often stayed on its old view after a click (choosing Music didn't show the Ducking section), until you moved the mouse over them. Wine copied a panel's new frame to the screen a moment too early and got the previous one; it now copies sparse frames a second time (patch 0126). Patch 0125 also repaints a new window once just after it appears (`WINE_SHOW_REDRAW=0` turns that off).
- **Faster interface drawing, from nvb-uy's fork.** Sixteen Wine fixes by nvb-uy (PhotoshopWine), patches 0109-0124: GDI+ drawing is faster with identical pixels (Photoshop's top-30 scripted tasks took 48 s instead of 77 s here), text widths match what is drawn so message boxes stop cutting off letters, file dialog buttons fit their label, windows without an icon show the app's icon, tray icons have names, and no Wine window pops up while the prefix updates. Thanks, nvb-uy!
- `adobewine report` shows the NVIDIA driver inside the Flatpak too (it used to say "none" there), and lists the Flatpak's GL extensions, whose NVIDIA one has to match the system driver (#26).

## 0.5.5 - 2026-11-01

- **AdobeWine is now LinDobe**, an Adobe adapter for Wine on Linux. It's an independent project, not made by or
  affiliated with Adobe. The repository moved to `le-birnes/LinDobe`, and old links redirect. The `adobewine` command,
  package names, Flatpak ID and data folders stay as they are for now, so existing installs and the 0.5.4 steps keep
  working.
- **Premiere on AMD no longer needs a manual setting for black frames.** LinDobe now sets the compile option AMD's
  OpenCL needs, found by the reporter in #15. Without AMD's driver, the launcher points you to it, and
  `adobewine report` now lists the OpenCL drivers.
- **Tested on Intel graphics.** On an Iris Xe laptop GPU, with NVIDIA switched off: Photoshop's 30 most-used functions
  gave the same results as on NVIDIA, and Premiere's 24 scripted functions exported correctly. Premiere rejects this GPU
  ("Hardware out of date") and renders on the CPU there, so it's slower.
- Patch 0097's notes no longer call it clean-room. They now describe how it was made, including that its specification
  came from a study that decompiled Windows' mspatcha.dll.

## 0.5.4 - 2026-11-01

- **The Flatpak no longer looks like a different computer to Adobe.** Wine read the machine ID from a file Flatpak
  sandboxes don't have, so it reported a placeholder, and Adobe counted the Flatpak as a new device. That could use up
  one of your two device slots and open the "too many devices" page. Wine now uses `/etc/machine-id`, so the Flatpak and
  a native install on the same computer report the same machine (0107). If you already activated Adobe in the Flatpak,
  it will count as a new device once after this update.

## 0.5.3 - 2026-11-01

- **Adobe's "too many devices" page now draws.** It was blank, which left you stuck when Adobe asked you to sign out of
  a device. Wine's browser engine lacked `createTreeWalker` and `NodeFilter` (0105), and cut long sign-in URLs at 2084
  characters and read stray memory after them (0105). The X on the window closes the app. The page's "Quit" button
  does nothing yet.
- Emoji and other characters outside the basic Unicode range no longer make `encodeURIComponent` fail in Wine's
  script engine (0106).

## 0.5.2 - 2026-10-31

- **Flatpak: apps that need Microsoft's Visual C++ runtime now start.** The Flatpak's space-saving links made
  Microsoft's redistributable fail, so Lightroom stopped at once with "mfc140u.dll not found". Updating repairs
  existing setups; after updating, open Creative Cloud and install or update an app so it can run the
  redistributable again.
- **Blank licensing window fixed for good:** Adobe's Chromium licensing window draws nothing under Wine, and `fix-signin` looked in the wrong folder. The launcher now switches to the working one at every start, because Creative Cloud restores the file when it updates.
- Known: Adobe's "too many devices" page still can't draw. Sign out of a device at account.adobe.com instead.
- Photoshop's contextual task bar no longer floats above other apps and takes their clicks (0104).

## 0.5.0 - 2026-10-31

- **Five more apps in the menu and the AdobeWine window:** InDesign, Bridge, Lightroom Classic, Lightroom and Acrobat.
  `adobewine off` closes them too.
- **Acrobat no longer crashes at start** in the setups where it did: two bugs in Wine's signature checking, one a
  race between threads (0103). The background helpers acrotray and AdobeCollabSync stopped aborting too.
- **The Windows side is mapped:** every Windows function imported by 5664 Adobe program files was checked against
  Wine ([docs/DLL-MAP.md](docs/DLL-MAP.md)). Of 107 gaps, 104 are closed (0101, 0102). Most of those report "not
  available here" where Windows without that feature would; they don't add the feature. The other 3 belong to DXVK
  and vkd3d. A function that exists isn't proof it behaves like Windows: that is what the app tests are for.
- Arch: a ready-made package on the release page, installed with `pacman -U`.
- **Now based on Wine 11.20**, with 101 patches. New: patches 0092-0103 (installers, Acrobat, thread start-up).
- Bridge, Lightroom Classic and Lightroom install from Creative Cloud and open (first tests, 2026-10-30).
- Lightroom Classic: 21 everyday functions tested and working, including AI Subject masking. Bridge: 26 tested and working, including Batch Rename, Camera Raw, Image Processor and Output to PDF.
- A failed install no longer breaks the other apps: when Acrobat's installer failed, Wine's rollback deleted the
  Microsoft Visual C++ runtime that every Adobe app needs (patches 0093, 0094).
- **Acrobat Pro installs and works.** Wine can now apply the update patches Acrobat's installer uses (0097, written
  from a behaviour description and checked against Windows: all 3534 of Acrobat's patches come out
  identical), and installs the update's files from the right place (0096, 0098). 22 everyday functions tested and
  working: open and read, comments and highlights, adding text, rotating, form fields, combining, extracting and
  deleting pages, export to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, RTF, text, JPEG and PNG, signing with a digital ID, zoom and
  page layout, and creating a PDF from a JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF or GIF (0099: Acrobat converts images in a small
  sandbox and checks who owns its connection to it; Wine now answers as Windows does), printing (through Wine's
  PostScript driver), OCR of a scanned page, and Fill & Sign (text and check marks). Acrobat's Protected Mode is
  switched off (Wine has no sandbox for it).
- Bridge: 26 everyday functions tested and working (browse, previews, ratings, keywords, metadata, collections,
  stacks, batch rename, Camera Raw, Image Processor, the Export panel, contact sheets to PDF, Filter panel, search,
  workspaces).
- Lightroom Classic: 18 everyday functions tested and working (import, ratings, keywords, collections, Develop
  edits and presets, virtual copies, export to JPEG, TIFF, PSD and DNG). Exporting to a folder on a separate
  disk or partition (for example a separate /home) failed with "The file could not be written"; fixed (0095).

## 0.4.1 - 2026-10-25

- New README for people who want to try Linux and keep working with Adobe: install in five steps, what works, what
  to know; the technical parts moved down or into docs/.
- The Flatpak's first start is faster and smaller: from Open to Adobe's installer in about 50 s instead of 90 s,
  and about 210 MB less on disk per user. Setup unpacks the core fonts itself instead of through winetricks
  (2 s instead of 45 s, same files and checksums), hardlinks Windows Installer's copies of Gecko and Mono to the
  downloads instead of storing them twice, and drops the DXVK/vkd3d-proton/nvidia-libs archives once unpacked.
- The first-run window downloads Creative Cloud with curl: Adobe's server ended about half of the previous
  downloads at 1 MB, and three failures in a row stopped the setup with an error.
- Gecko and Mono downloads are checked against their checksums, so a download cut short is fetched again
  instead of kept.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-10-24

- **One file for every distribution: `CCINSTALLER.flatpak`.** Double-click it, click Install in your app store, then
  Open. A small window checks the computer (Vulkan GPU, disk space), sets everything up with a progress bar,
  downloads Adobe's current Creative Cloud installer from adobe.com and starts it, and stops at Adobe's sign-in.
  Afterwards it lists the installed apps with Open buttons, adds them to the app menu, closes them all, and makes
  problem reports (shown in full before anything is sent). After an AdobeWine update it refreshes the setup once.
  The Flatpak carries Wine with all patches, the patched GPU layers, the Windows-side helpers, Selawik as a Segoe UI
  stand-in, winetricks and the rest, on the GNOME runtime from Flathub. Recipe: `packaging/flatpak`, build with
  `packaging/flatpak/make-bundle.sh`; distribution check: `tests/distro/flatpak-check.sh`.
- Setup no longer stops on a brand-new prefix: the InDesign scripting check added for 0088 ended setup when
  InDesign had never been installed (new in 0.3.1), nor where `xrdb` is missing (the desktop's scale
  then cannot be read and 96 DPI is used).
- Setup downloads Gecko and Mono before Wine's first boot and puts them where Wine looks for them, so Wine installs
  and registers them silently instead of asking in a dialog. Adobe's current web installer (5.3.5.13) needs the
  browser engine registered from that first boot; without it the installer window stayed hidden.
- With `ADOBEWINE_LINK_DLLS=1` (set by the Flatpak), setup links Wine's own DLLs into the prefix instead of copying
  them, as Proton does: a new prefix is 773 MB instead of 2.4 GB.
- Shader caches (vkd3d-proton, DXVK) go to `~/.local/share/adobewine/cache/shaders` instead of the folder an app
  was started from.
- `adobewine launchers` writes menu entries that run `ADOBEWINE_EXEC` when it is set (the Flatpak's own command).

- Illustrator: floating panels (Transform, Color, Align...) show again; they were invisible and blocked clicks on
  the part of the canvas they covered (patch 0091).
- InDesign: after double-clicking or dragging over text, Ctrl shortcuts work again (Ctrl+Shift+B typed a "B" over
  the word, Ctrl+A typed "a"). InDesign activates a small invisible window over the selection, and Wine handed it to
  the window manager, which moved the keyboard focus around mid-shortcut (patch 0090).
- After Effects' Render Queue panel works by hand: opening it (Ctrl+Alt+0, or Composition > Add to Render Queue)
  left it blank and stopped After Effects' background work, so scripts timed out. A shape the panel draws failed
  to build in Wine's Direct2D; a group made from it then read freed memory, and the fault left After Effects half
  way through building the panel (patch 0089). Add to Render Queue, Output To and Render now work from the panel.
- InDesign can be scripted from other programs over COM again (VBScript, Python, automation tools): it builds its
  scripting type library with Wine's CreateTypeLib2 and gives hundreds of functions an empty doc string, which made
  Wine's save fail and write nothing, so InDesign answered "unknown name" for DoScript (patch 0088,
  `tests/typelib/emptydoc.c`). Rerun `adobewine setup` after updating: it removes the stale registration, and
  InDesign writes the library on its next start.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-10-23

- Showreel: a short film made entirely in the Adobe apps under AdobeWine, every file created,
  rendered and exported on Linux: https://youtu.be/3Vbzt4cGSQQ. Photoshop painting with pen
  pressure, Illustrator Blob Brush lettering and Pathfinder, an InDesign report (styles, table,
  placed PSD and AI files, PDF export), Audition music (Generate Tones, Studio Reverb, Normalize),
  After Effects 3D titles (Cinema 4D renderer), shape layers, particles and audio spectrum rendered
  with aerender, and the cut, Lumetri grades and transitions in Premiere Pro, exported through
  Media Encoder. The pen strokes come from the simulated tablet (`tools/pen.py`) and most steps were
  scripted.
- `tools/pen.py`: `curve` (a quadratic stroke) and `path` (one stroke through many points, pressure
  swelling from `PEN_LO` to `PEN_HI` and back) for drawing lettering and brush strokes.
- Illustrator's canvas works with mouse and pen while another Adobe app is open: switching apps left the
  other app's window on top in Wine's own window order, so Illustrator ignored every click and drag on
  the canvas (patch 0087, `tests/zorder/zorder.c`).
- Scripting an Adobe app over COM (as automation tools and other apps do) works again after the
  app was killed or crashed and restarted; Wine's rpcss kept the dead instance's registration
  (patch 0086).

## 0.3.0 - 2026-10-21

- Packages: the AUR packages build the patched vkd3d-proton and CUDA bridge the After Effects viewers
  need (`scripts/build-gpu-deps.sh`) and `adobewine setup` installs them; rerun `adobewine setup`
  after updating.
- Premiere Pro on AMD GPUs with Mesa's OpenCL (rusticl): it quit right after the splash
  because Wine's OpenCL lacked `clCreateCommandQueueWithProperties`, which Premiere's OpenVINO GPU
  plugin imports (patch 0085, `tests/opencl/cqprops.c`; confirmation on AMD pending). Found with
  the logs in #15; on older releases, `OCL_ICD_VENDORS=/nonexistent adobewine premiere`
  works around it.
- Premiere Pro no longer freezes for good while dragging clips in the timeline (a lock-order
  deadlock in the offscreen-surface re-copy, patch 0083), and its UI no longer spends most of its
  time recompiling Direct2D shaders for every render target (patch 0084, render targets ~25x faster
  to create). Both by @Cikappa2904 (#14), with `tests/layered/flushrace.c` and `tests/d2d/rtcreate.c`.
- Real production job as an end-to-end test: a 320-layer After Effects comp with animated captions
  renders like on Windows, and its Premiere cut, with the comp through Dynamic Link (a headless After
  Effects renders it), exports 10 s in 14.5-20 s (Windows 19.6 s); the output matches Windows' export of the same cut
  (SSIM 0.993, PSNR 49 dB, audio identical).
- Premiere Pro: the Import and Export modes draw; they stayed black. The main window has its own
  always-black Direct3D swapchain that was copied over the modes' child windows (patch 0082).
- After Effects: the Composition and Layer viewers show the composition again with GPU (CUDA) rendering on
  NVIDIA; they stayed black. AE passes CUDA frames to its Direct3D 12 viewer through CUDA interop: patches
  0079-0081, a vkd3d-proton patch (shared buffers exportable) and a CUDA bridge patch (D3D11 interop,
  D3D handles through Wine's D3DKMT), built by `scripts/build-gpu-deps.sh` and installed by setup.
- Pen tablets work under XWayland without extra software (patch 0075): Photoshop (set
  `UseSystemStylus 0` in `PSUserConfig.txt`), Illustrator and After Effects follow pen pressure, and
  InDesign and Premiere get the pen as a pen. Wine now reads the tablet through XInput2 and also
  delivers it as Windows Ink pen input. `tools/pen.py` simulates a pen for testing; `tests/pen` has
  the test scripts and a probe (#13).
- After Effects: no more "Direct2D Drawbot error" on every redraw; its panels draw again (patch 0076).
- Creative Cloud's self-update to 6.11 no longer takes the whole desktop session down: a helper
  started without a desktop made Wine start explorer after explorer (250 in a second) until X ran
  out of clients and memory and swap filled (patch 0072). New `tools/sandbox.sh` runs a command
  in a memory-capped systemd scope and kills it if it runs away, or when X connections near
  XWayland's limit.
- Creative Cloud's update helpers get a desktop (patch 0073) and, running with a restricted token,
  can read the display configuration again (patch 0074; before, they saw a 1024x768 screen).
  Helpers that reach Wine's window code before user32 sets it up no longer hang on their first
  window or lose the display configuration (patch 0077); the step that swaps the updated files in
  now finishes, and the 6.11 self-update completes on its own, including the Visual C++ runtime
  it installs (patch 0078).
- Creative Cloud's Adobe Fonts sync no longer makes every program started afterwards crash (patch
  0078): a font it added and removed again that has the same name as one of your system fonts (Open
  Sans) corrupted Wine's font list in each new process. This was behind the VC++ installer failing
  during the update and the storms of crashing console windows.
- Photoshop rendering and speed on Wayland/NVIDIA, by nvb-uy (#12): text without FreeType
  auto-hinting and with quarter-pixel glyph positions like on Windows, no colour fringes next to
  Direct2D text (`config/fonts.conf`), multisampled and analytic antialiasing in Direct2D,
  antialiased GDI+ paths and lines (Wine MR 12221 by Thomas Ritter), offscreen swapchains paced
  to the display refresh rate, and AdobeNotificationHelper no longer aborts (patches 0063-0071).
- Heap patch 0027 revised: emptied heap segments are still kept mapped for apps that touch freed
  memory, but are no longer reused, so allocations are placed as in stock Wine (Wine's kernel32 heap
  test had 4 failures on 32-bit). New test tests/heap/keep.c.
- After Effects loads the Mocha AE plug-in (patch 0054, private assemblies through a `.config`
  file's privatePath). It was written right after 0.1.0 but had been left out of the public
  patch set by mistake.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-10-11

- After Effects renders: adding a comp to the Render Queue no longer kills its main thread (stack
  overflow in Wine's Direct2D triangulation, patch 0061). Tested with a real 300-layer comp.
- winedbg can attach to processes whose main thread has exited (patch 0062).
- Desktop file picker (experimental, `WINE_FORCE_PORTAL=1`): After Effects' "Format:" list shows its real
  label instead of "Option 1" (patch 0060b). Portal tests added in tests/portal.
- HiDPI: `adobewine setup` sets Wine's DPI from your desktop's scale (Xft.dpi), so the Adobe apps are
  no longer tiny on 1.5x/2x screens; `--dpi N` chooses another value.
- Illustrator's PSD and SVG exports use Myriad Pro like on Windows (they fell back to Times New
  Roman): the launcher puts Adobe's core fonts (Myriad Pro, Minion Pro) from an installed app into
  Common Files\\Adobe\\Fonts, the shared folder Adobe's installers create on Windows.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-10-10

- `adobewine aftereffects` starts After Effects (newest installed release).
- The launcher notices an app that closed but did not exit (no window, process still there) and
  ends only that app, instead of handing the new launch to it so that nothing opens.
- `bin/env.sh` works when sourced from zsh.
- Patch 0039 revised: chunked keep-alive replies no longer drop their connection (Wine's
  winhttp:notification tests pass again), and WinHttpReadData no longer waits to fill the
  buffer when some data is already there. New test: tests/winhttp/readavail.c.
- Patch 0035 revised: local scripts' load event fires after their 'complete' state change, as in
  IE, so Wine's mshtml script tests no longer hang. New test page: tests/mshtml/loadevents.html.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-10

- Wine 11.18 with 59 patches.
- Patch 0058: `DISPLAYCONFIG_DEVICE_INFO_GET_SDR_WHITE_LEVEL`, which Photoshop's GPU check asks for
  (switch87, #6).
- Setup makes Segoe UI from Selawik when no Windows fonts are given, so Photoshop's menu bar
  no longer hangs without them (switch87, #3).
- Setup reports Direct3D 12 feature level 12_0/12_1 on GPUs whose Vulkan driver offers only 11_x
  (e.g. Mesa on Gen9 Intel), so Photoshop finds the GPU and Camera Raw can edit (switch87, #4).
- `adobewine <app>` and the menu entries start the newest installed release (e.g. Photoshop
  2025), and menu entries get the app icons again (switch87, #5).
- Gentoo install guide for the `::snakebyte` overlay (switch87, #7).
- Patch 0043 fixed: a program that added a font itself and then listed fonts could lose a font
  family or hang (found by Wine's own gdi32 tests).
- Patch 0046 narrowed: Wine's winhttp notification tests pass again; Photoshop still closes
  cleanly.
- Creative Cloud web installer 2.14.0.82 no longer shows a blank white window: patches 0055-0057
  (mshtml ChildNode methods and `indeterminate`, jscript `Object.entries/values/assign`). Cause
  found by NickPittas (#2). The temporary launcher workaround for 0.1.0 runtimes is gone again,
  as the runtime now has the fix.
- Experimental, off by default: Windows file dialogs can use your desktop's own file picker
  (XDG portal) with `WINE_FORCE_PORTAL=1`; After Effects' import options show in it. Patches
  0060a/0060b, ported from NickPittas' AE4Linux (LGPL-2.1+) and Wine merge request 10060 by
  Alexander Wilms.

## 0.1.0 - first public testing release

- Wine 11.18 with 53 patches (3 from PhialsBasement's Adobe installer work, 50 new).
- Tested on CachyOS with an NVIDIA RTX 4070 Laptop GPU: Creative Cloud desktop 6.10,
  Photoshop 27.10, Illustrator 30.8, Premiere Pro 26.5, Audition 26.5 and Media Encoder 26.5
  (see docs/STATUS.md).
- `adobewine` command: setup, app launching with Linux file paths, clean shutdown,
  sign-in fix, desktop menu entries, opt-in scrubbed crash reports.
- AUR packages `adobewine` (build) and `adobewine-bin` (prebuilt).
